<h1>The measure</h1>
<p>Texts have an ideal length of line. If they get too wide, it becomes hard to find the next line in running text. If they're too small you have to move your eyes to the next line too often. The ideal measure depends on quite a few factors, like font, size of the font, line-height, <em>language</em> etc. But there are a few easy to remember rules of thumb that work most of the time. </p>

<ul>
	<li>The minimum width of the measure is 20em</li>
	<li>The maximum width of the measure is 40em</li>
	<li>The ideal width of the measure is 30em</li>
	<li>An average of 10 words is easy to read</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, these are rules of thumb, not rules cast in stone.</p>
